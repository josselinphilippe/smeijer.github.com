//...The types[] array in the result indicates the address type. Examples of address types include a street address, a country, or a political entity. There is also a types[] array in the address_components[], indicating the type of each part of the address.
//Examples include street number or country. (Below is a full list of types.) Addresses may have multiple types. 
//The types may be considered 'tags'. For example, many cities are tagged with the political and the locality type.

//The following types are supported and returned by the geocoder in both the address type and address component type arrays:

//street_address indicates a precise street address.
//route indicates a named route (such as "US 101").
//intersection indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.
//political indicates a political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.
//country indicates the national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.
//administrative_area_level_1 indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
//administrative_area_level_2 indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
//administrative_area_level_3 indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
//administrative_area_level_4 indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
//administrative_area_level_5 indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
//colloquial_area indicates a commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
//locality indicates an incorporated city or town political entity.
//ward indicates a specific type of Japanese locality, to facilitate distinction between multiple locality components within a Japanese address.
//sublocality indicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: sublocality_level_1 to sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.
//neighborhood indicates a named neighborhood
//premise indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name
//subpremise indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
//postal_code indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.
//natural_feature indicates a prominent natural feature.
//airport indicates an airport.
//park indicates a named park.
//point_of_interest indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Statue of Liberty."//
               

//for our purpose, we can thus restrict the geosearch to location results in the locality that is Newark (note: this could be trickier with a more commmon place name)
